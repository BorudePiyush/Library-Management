## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Login & Authentication:**  
   Users (admin or member) log in through a secure form. Passwords are stored securely in the database.

2. **Dashboard:**  
   After login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards with options based on their roles.

3. **Book Operations:**  
   - **Admin:** Can add, edit, or remove books, and view all issued books.
   - **Member:** Can search for books, view availability, and request for issue.

4. **Issue/Return:**  
   - Admin issues or returns books to members; the system updates inventory and records the transaction.

5. **Search & Filter:**  
   - Dynamic search bar and filter options using JavaScript and Bootstrap for real-time results.

6. **Notifications:**  
   - System can send alerts for overdue books or pending returns (can be extended via email/SMS APIs).
